**Update**: *Binder fails to render with Voila so use the below URL to access the Jupyter Notebook*
In case the button doesn't work: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/robml/climax-easter-egg/HEAD?urlpath=%2notebooks%2Fxxx-ai-model-v1.0-voila.ipynb

This is still part of alpha testing, details on how to execute are given by invite only. Email robjrm@gmail.com for more details or reach out on Github.
